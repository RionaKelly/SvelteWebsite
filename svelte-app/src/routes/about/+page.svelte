<p>Hi! We are Lilac, a small women-owned tea business based in Tea City.</p>
<p>We were dissapointed by the current choices in healthy drinks that could be found on the market right now, and felt like we could do better. And we were right!</p>
<p>Since then we have expanded our business across three more continents, all thanks to the incredible support from our consumers. </p>
<p>Please call us at 08500000 or email us at LilacTea@gmail.com!</p>
