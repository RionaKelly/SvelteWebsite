### Summary
Our website will be an ecommerce website made for selling healthy tea, but as a website it’s goal is to allow users to easily browse and purchase our stock in an intuitive and accessible manner. Our primary audience is young adults and people interested in health drinks. We want our users to be able to easily browse and purchase from our website without any complication, regardless of who they are.

### Design Rationale
We chose this theme because we wanted to design something colourful and fun, and a drink ecommerce website seemed like a good choice. Our primary goals as part of the design for this website were to showcase our products and allow users to add them to a cart for purchase, create a colourful and fun website to represent our brand, and to design an easy to use and accesible website that is responsive and functional on any platform.

During our research we used personas to find out what our users' goals and needs would be and through this process we disovered some general design choices that we should utilise to create the best experience for our users, and some specific design choices that would be helful to implement. Some of these choices that we discovered were:
- To use visually appealing colours with high contrast
- Use interactive elements, such as a carousel and hover effects
- Keep a consistent design throughout the whole project
- Avoid visual clutter
- Make the website accessibile

### Key Features
The pages of our website are the:
Landing Page
About Page

Contact Information Page
Frequently Asked Questions

Our website is responsive and functional on most screen sizes and browsers, we have not found a device or browser that had any issues. Our website is also very accesible, featuring colours with high contrast 

### Technologies Used
We used Svelte.js for our website as a UI framework to assist with the creation and running of our website. We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to code our website. And we used GitHub for the hosting of our website and Penpot for the design of the prototypes.

        During the process of creating this website I learned a lot about designing websites to keep them accesible and some great general rules for designing for users. We went through a lot of designs and reiteration to get to where we are now but I really enjoyed the process and once I knew what my goal was, I was fine creating the website as I think I'm good at figuring out how things work. We also definitely had issues with certain elements such as the footer and cards, but as a team and by asking for help sometimes we managed to get everything working.

        One of the main challenges I faced was on the Contact page. I was having trouble with keeping the footer at the bottom of the page and it not interfering with the positioning of some of the other boxes I had on the screen. I asked our lecturer for some help and the issue was resolved by wrapping the header, main and footer files in a div with an id called “layout-container” and added styles to ensure that the footer stays at the bottom of the page no matter what.
        During the process, I learned the importance of proper page structure and how using a wrapper container can help manage the layout more effectively. I also improved my understanding of CSS positioning techniques, mainly how to make elements like the footer stay consistently at the bottom of the page without affecting the layout of other components.

### Deployment Notes

I struggled with deploying the website for a bit when I tried to do it on my own but after following the instructions on Blackboard and a little bit of trial and error it all worked.
